This is a meteor/react/bootstrap proof-of-concept application of a "AI-driven interview" concept created during the Feb 3-4 2018 DevWeek Hackathon in SF.

The workflow consists of 3 phases:
1- The interviewer creates an interview instance with an interviewee.
2- The interviewee then sees the invitation and can start the interview which consists of pre-recorded question videos and a way to record the answer as videos with his computer.
3- Once the interview is done, the idea was to upload the video to the Veritone back-end for transcription (and possibly sentiment analysis). The interviwer can then do a review by skimming through the transcripts and look at specific videos if needed before making the decision to move forward or reject the application.
